## 🧩 Risk Management Strategy

We assessed over 40 unique risks and categorized them under:
- Technical (e.g., cooling failures, system integration)
- Regulatory (e.g., permit delays, compliance issues)
- Environmental (e.g., coastal corrosion, flooding)
- Operational (e.g., workforce gaps, cybersecurity)
- Financial (e.g., funding shortfalls, inflation)

Each risk is accompanied by a **mitigation plan**, owner, and status tracker.
